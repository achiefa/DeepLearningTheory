In Sect.~\ref{sec:CentralValue} and~\ref{sec:Covariance} we obtained some simplified expressions 
for the mean and the covariance of the trained networks under the assumption that the fluctuations
of the evolution operators $U(t)$ and |$V(t)$ are independent of the fluctuations of the networks 
at initialization. Here we quantify this assumption by computing these correlations explicitly 
for the dataset and architectures used in this work. In the absence of general theorems, it is necessary 
to verify the validity of these assumptions case by case.
