\begin{abstract}
  Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) play a crucial role in describing
  experimental data at hadron colliders and provide insight into proton
  structure. As the LHC enters an era of high-precision measurements, a robust
  PDF determination with a reliable uncertainty quantification has become
  increasingly important to match the experimental precision. The NNPDF
  collaboration has pioneered the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques for PDF
  determination. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework based on the
  Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) to analyze the training dynamics of Neural
  Networks. This approach allows us to derive, under certain assumptions, an
  analytical description of how the neural network evolves during training,
  enabling us to better understand the NNPDF methodology and its dependence on
  the underlying model architecture. Notably, we demonstrate that our results
  contrast, to some extent, with the standard picture of the \textit{lazy training}
  regime commonly discussed in the ML community.
